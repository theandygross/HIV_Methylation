      "We have finished a thorough analysis of the HIV aging phenotype and so far the advanced age we observed seems robust. We also analyzed other general systemic stresses like cancer, schizophrenia, and dementia without observing any changes in aging. We have now begun to take cell composition into account and it seems that there is some link between the biological HIV methylome age and NK-cell count. Is it possible to get the leukocyte panel for these samples? I think this is the next thing we will have to take into account.\n",

      "here we go with all the hematology and chemistry/metabolic data. They did not do NK cell count, not unexpected, most don't, as NK cells are never that frequent. Since the DNA was made from whole blood in general ~50% of the cells are neutrophils and ~40% are lymphocytes (and then ~10% monocytes and other cells); of the lymphocytes usually a max of ~10% are NK cells so those would only contribute 4% of the signal from the DNA. \n",
      "But anyway here is everything. The main thing of interest to the HIV field is the absolute CD4 cell count. Normal is low of 400-500 to a high of 1000-1500, depending on definitions. <200 gets you a definition of immunosuppressed/AIDS; on this sheet the median is 480 and 14 are <200, so of course down but not really that bad.\n",
      "There are some missing values we can double check on, and some things that clearly look off (specifically the Absolute Lymphocyte count, think those ones with single digits and a decimal really should be x1000) but can start here. Note that for Plasma HIV RNA (rnvalue PLASMA), for the log10 values (rnlog10 PLASMA) those equal to or below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ), which is 50, are all assigned the log10 of 50 (1.69897 or 1.699 depending on their rounding).\n",
