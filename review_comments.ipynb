    "I apologize for the delay and I am enclosing the comments that the reviewers made on your paper. The view is that the results are potentially interesting, but that it would be premature to consider the paper further for Molecular Cell without the inclusion of significant further data. __Both reviewers have concerns about the analysis from the mix cell population and suggest that age and HIV signatures should be reproduced in flow-sorted cell population.__ It is difficult to say whether it would be appropriate to consider a revised paper without knowing the results of the further experiments that the reviewers require. In principle, we consider resubmissions to satisfy reviewers' concerns only within a two month period after the original decision. I hope the detailed comments will be helpful. I should also mention that you will not be able to submit a revised manuscript in EM without contacting me first to request reactivation of the file. If you do decide to submit a revised manuscript, please send me a detailed description of the new data and a response to the reviewers' criticisms when you are ready to do so and I will be happy to discuss with you whether I think it will be productive to continue consideration of the paper. \n",

The associations fed into this analysis were modeled in a multi-variate context with celular composition variables as covariates. In hindsight we agree that the inclusion of Figure 4E does serve to confuse the reader as it seems to suggest that these changes could be due __exclusively__ to cellular composition as opposed to HIV infection.

The hypothesis is that when a site is under active regulation, most cells will have a consistant methylation status, thus the pooled population state will approach a 0% or 100% methylation state.

While these effects are real and significant, a large portion of the cell-composition remodeling take place within individuals that are very old or very young. Within the age range of our study (25-68 years) these effects are much more moderate.

Despite it now well established confounding nature with studies such as ours, methylation at sites which are variable across cell types should not be discounted from such studies. There remain many situations in which methylation may change __within__ any one given cell type which could be biologically meaningfull. The confounding factor occurs when the methylation within any given cell remains constant, but changing the mixture of cellular populations gives rise to an observed change in the pooled methylation estimate. In fact, we would argue that a methylation site that is differentially methylated in a given cell type is more likely to change in response to a cellular stress such as aging or HIV due to its percived importance in that particular cell type.

In contrast for the HIV associated probes, we see a small enrichment for nominally cell-type specific probes (odds-ratio 1.2 for P < .1) which becomes neutral negative enrichment for stronger association with cell type (odd-ratio .95, for P < 10e-6).
