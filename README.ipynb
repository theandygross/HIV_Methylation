    "This is a fairly complex analysis pipeline, with many steps.  If you are planning of running the entire pipeline starting from raw data, this should be possible with the attached code, but I highly recomend you contact me (the.andrew.gross AT gmail DOT com) for assistance. Some steps in this process have relatively specialized requirements such as high memory machines or use of a compute cluster. \n",

    "Finally all of the analyses done here are represented in IPython notebooks.  This was meant to allow for __high level inspection__ of the analysis logic done for this study. I have done my best to document this such that it can be understood __without running the actual code__.  If you are interesting in reproducing this study, or conducting a similar study I highly recomend __looking before you leap__ into trying to get code to run.  "
